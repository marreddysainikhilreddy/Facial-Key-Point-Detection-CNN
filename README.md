## Project Overview
<b><p align="justify"> These keypoints mark important areas of the face: the eyes, corners of the mouth, the nose, etc. Facial Key Points (FKPs) detection is an important and
challenging problem in the field of computer vision, which
involves detecting FKPs like centers and corners of eyes, 
nose tip, etc.</p></b>
